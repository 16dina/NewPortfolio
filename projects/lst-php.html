                    This is a Staff management web application for an au pair staying within the Anderson's household
                    that
                    consists of grandparents, a grandchild who is autistic and needs special care, staff members
                    including a cook, and of course, the au pair.

                            After completing the requirements analysis for the 'Staff Management System' project (read
                            more about it <a href="/projects/staffManagementSystem.html" class="here" target="_blank">here</a>), it was time to turn the web application into a reality. My team and I
                            had a design report, prototypes, and feedback from both the customer and the teacher to
                            start programming the real application. As part of our 'Project PHP' class, which serves as
                            a practice course for what was taught in a previous class called 'Web Applications in PHP,'
                            I had the opportunity to work with my team again to develop the web application. This
                            project class included weekly meetings where we had a stand-up meeting, updated the JIRA
                            scrum board, helped each other, asked for help from teachers when needed, brainstormed
                            ideas, coded and pushed to GitHub, and had fun with the team. We also conducted meetings
                            with the client periodically to ensure we met their requirements and expectations.
                            Additionally, we implemented various user support methods that we thought would be helpful,
                            particularly for the elderly and those who require special care. The web framework used was
                            Laravel 9, along with Tailwind CSS, and we also used Livewire, a full-stack framework for
                            Laravel that helps build dynamic websites.

                <div class="collapsable">
                    <input type="checkbox" id="collapsable-head-2">
                    <label for="collapsable-head-2">About this app</label>
                    <div class="project-section-content">
                        <p>

                            The main goal of the application is to make the au pair's job in managing the household
                            easier, be it managing tasks, appointments, staff members, meals, documents, etc. The client
                            wanted a centralized application where she can view everything and be capable of making
                            changes with a click of a button. This app will also make the staff members' work easier to
                            track and ease communication between all people in the house. It also helps the grandparents
                            keep an eye on everything going on around the household. The grandson is capable of viewing
                            who is in the house and at what time in order to schedule his visits. The app makes all
                            these processes more efficient by improving communication, organization, and accessibility
                            of information. The system focuses on ease of use and speed for the elderly couple, au pair,
                            and staff.

                        <p>
                            I am serving as the Scrum Master for this project. My responsibilities include updating the
                            JIRA platform, ensuring that everyone is on track and has at least one active task at all
                            times, making daily stand-up meeting reports, and sending them to the teachers. I also take
                            the lead in contacting the client and presenting what the team has accomplished.

                            On the technical side, I am responsible for creating the pages to manage invoices and files.
                            This involves setting up the related database tables, programming the mobile view, ensuring
                            that files are secure, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities on
                            them based on the authorization level of the logged-in user. I have also implemented user
                            support through tooltips and a guided tour of the page.

                            Additionally, I helped out a team member by taking over the task of creating the edit and
                            delete functionalities for absences that staff members may declare.

                            Later on, at the client's request, I implemented an "undo" functionality for the users in
                            case someone accidentally deletes a file or invoice.
