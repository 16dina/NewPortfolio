                    consists of grandparents, a grandchild who is autistic and needs special care, staff members
                    including a cook, and of course, the au pair.

                            After the requirements analysis project 'Staff management system' (read more about that
                            project here), it was time to make the web application a reality. My team and I now had a
                            design report, prototypes, and both customer and teacher feedback to start working on
                            programming the real thing. As part of our 'Project PHP' class which serves as a practice
                            course for what was taught in a previous class called 'Web Applications in PHP', I had the
                            opportunity to work with my team again in making the web application. This project class
                            included weekly classes where we have a stand-up meeting, update the JIRA scrum board, help
                            each other, ask help from teachers when needed, brainstorm ideas, code and push to GitHub,
                            and of course have fun with the team. Meetings with the client were also conducted every now
                            and then in order to make sure we're meeting their requirements and wants. In addition, we
                            implemented various methods of user support that we thought would be helpful for the users
                            especially since some are elderly and people who need special care. The web framework used
                            is Laravel 9 along with Tailwind CSS. We also used Livewire which is a full-stack framework
                            for Laravel that helps build dynamic websites.

                        <p>
                            The main goal of the application is to make the au pair's jon in managing the househol
                            easier. Be it managing tasks, appointments, staff members, meals, documents, etc. The client
                            wanted a centralized application where she can view everything and be capable of making
                            changes with a click of the button. This app will also make the staff memebers' work easier
                            to track nd ease communication between all people in the house. It also helps the
                            grandparents keep an eye on everything going around the household. The grandson is capable
                            of viewing wh is in the house and at what time in order to schedule his visits. The app
                            makes all these processes more efficient by improving communication, organization, and
                            accessibility of information. The system focuses on ease of use and speed for the elderly
                            couple, au pair, and staff.

                            I serve as the scrum master for this project. I am responsible for updating the JIRA
                            platform, making sure everyone is on track and has at least one active task at all times,
                            making stand up meeting reports, and sending them to the teachers. I also take the lead in
                            contacting the client and presenting what the team accomplished. As for the technical side,
                            I'm responsible for making the pages to manage invoices and files. This included setting up
                            the related database tables, programming the mobile view, making sure files are secure,
                            performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities on them based on the
                            authorization level of the logged in user, and implementing user support through tooltips
                            and a guided tour of the page.
                            I also helped out a team member by taking over making the edit and delete functionalities of
                            the absences that staff members may declare.
                            Later on, per the client's request, I implemented an undo functionality for the users in
                            case someone deletes a file or invoice accidentally.
