                    This project was part of my Requirements Analysis class at Thomas More. In this project, I worked
                    with a team to make a web application for a client who is an au pair.

                        <p>
                            Our client, an au pair for an elderly couple in England, needs a web application to help her
                            manage her tasks and work more efficiently. The application needs to keep an overview of
                            when staff is working, keep track of paperwork and invoices, remember recurring appointments
                            and tasks, and plan meals. Currently, the system is chaotic, with some information on paper
                            and some online, making it easy to lose track of what is happening. The client is also
                            responsible for keeping track of the Andersons' autistic grandson, she would like to have an
                            overview of when he is visiting and be able to schedule things with him. The goal of the
                            project is to develop a central web application for the Anderson household staff, that will
                            help the head of the household and the au pair easily maintain an overview of everything
                            that is happening and plan the meals for the staff.

                        <p>
                            The main goal of the application is to make the job of all staff and family members easier
                            and more efficient by improving communication, organization, and accessibility of
                            information. The system will focus on ease of use and speed for the elderly couple, au pair,
                            and staff.

                            I was appointed as the scrum master, this meant that I will keep track of everyone's work
                            and that everything is going as planned. I was also responsible for designing the prototypes
                            of the pages to manage invoices and categories in the system. As a team, we worked together
                            and discussed how to model the database for this system.


                            Besides the previously mentioned tasks, I was specifically resonsible at the end for
                            reviewing and proofreading the team's report, checking the consistency of it, and finally
                            submitting it.
