                <p>This project was part of my Requirements Analysis class at Thomas More. In this
                    project, I
                    worked with a
                    team to make a web application for a client who is our study coach (a teacher at the university).

                            The Job Application Training is provided for graduating IT students at Thomas More
                            Hogeschool by the
                            coordinators. The third year students get the chance to participate in a mock job interview
                            with a
                            designated recruiter from participating IT companies.
                            Currently, this job application training is coordinated by 2 ITF lecturers using Word and
                            Excel
                            documents, email messages and multiple other platforms.
                            This approach of maintaining the information regarding bookings and appointments with the
                            use of
                            many
                            different channels and making it available on various platforms by the coordinators is very
                            labour-intensive.
                            The coordinators have to keep track of this information and make sure it is up-to-date and
                            accurate
                            by
                            continuously communicating with the parties involved (student and company), which can be
                            confusing
                            and
                            lead to miscommunication and delays.

                            The main goal of the requested web application is to simplify the administration process,
                            and to allow the coordinator to easily manage the booking and appointment information about
                            the involved parties. This will result in making the coordinator's job less
                            labour-intensive. More specifically, the parties involved will experience the following
                            benefits from this new system:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coordinators will spend less time managing student accounts, communicating with the
                                students and companies, and performing labour-intensive tasks. Booking interviews,
                                managing appointments, and providing feedback will be managed easily.</li>
                            <li>Companies will be able to easily share and update information about themselves.</li>
                            <li>Students will be able to easily view the participating companies, and more efficiently
                                schedule interviews. Information on scheduled interviews will be more clearly available
                                to them, reducing the risk of forgotten and overlapping interviews. They should still
                                have the option to cancel or reschedule an interview before a deadline.</li>

                            Since this project was a part of the Requirements Analysis class, our work was more about
                            analysing the client's request and determining their expectations for the end product. I
                            took part in interviewing the client, extracting functionalities, drawing out the use case
                            diagram, making prototypes for how the app would potentially look like, and finally writing
                            a report containing all the different use cases (functionalities) and each's description.
                            This report would then serve as the starting point later on for the next analysis and design
                            team when drawing out the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and for the developers when
                            programming the actual end product.


                            Besides the previously mentioned tasks, I was specifically resonsible at the end for
                            reviewing and proofreading the team's report, checking the consistency of it, and finally
                            submitting it.
