# New Portfolio Website by Dina Boshnaq
My name is Dina Boshnaq, I am an Applied Computer Science student at Thomas More University of Applied Sciences. This is my portfolio website where I provide an introduction about myself and showcase some of my projects.

The website was made by following a YouTube Tutorial and looking up how to do things myself. All the code is written from scratch by me, some is purely inspired by me too. Credits: Icons: Font Awesome (fontawesome.io)
